# proof-of-settlement

proof-of-settlement is an on-chain physical state & location verifier that uses a snark.

The proof can only be acquired by the subject from the real settled physical location of the proof created in zokrates.

Proof is verified by blockchain making this system incredibly secure.

main.zok codes;


```shell
def main(private u64 a) {

    assert(a%1907==67);
    return;
  }
```

(a%1907==67); represents the modular arithmetic formula that generates the proofs in that numerical order.

This modulo can be used to create authentic proofs inside QR codes attached to swag or any object to claim tokens/NFTs.

** Initially the modulo also provides the easy production of QR codes in large numbers without having the need to alter or make additions into the contract which is a huge save on time, data and dev costs.

** We first thought of this as a real life treasure hunt game but realized it could be used in other areas too. Feel free to gamify the concept and reach me out if you would like to improve on it to make a game.
