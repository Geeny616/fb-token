# proof-of-settlement

proof-of-settlement is an on-chain physical state & location verifier that uses a snark.

The proof can only be acquired by the subject from the real settled physical location of the proof created in zokrates.

Proof is verified by blockchain making this system incredibly secure.

main.zok codes;


```shell
def main(private u64 a) {

    assert(a%1907==67);
    return;
  }
```

(a%1907==67); represents the modular arithmetic formula that generates the proofs in that numerical order.

This modulo can be used to create authentic proofs inside QR codes attached to swag or any object to claim tokens/NFTs.
